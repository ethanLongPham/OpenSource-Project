    <h2>Set Up Introduction - Belle&Cozy Funiture E-commerce Website</h2>
    <p>First of all, download the "src_code_opensource" folder.</p>
    
    <h5>To run the web app on Raspberry Pi or Linux</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Open PuTTY and Connect to Your Raspberry Pi</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Open PuTTY</li>
            <li>Enter the IP address or hostname of your Raspberry Pi.</li>
            <li>Click "Open" and log in with your username and password.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Ensure Git is Installed: Before you can clone a repository, <br>
            you need to make sure that Git is installed on your Raspberry Pi. <br>
            Run the following command to check if Git is installed: git --version <br>
            If Git is not installed, you can install it using: sudo apt update
            sudo apt install git
        </li>
        <li>Navigate to the Desired Directory:
            Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. <br>
            For example, if you want to clone it to your home directory, <br>
            you can simply do: cd ~
        </li>
        <li>Clone the Repository:
            Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the GitHub repository <br>
            you want to clone. Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the repository: <br>
            git clone <repository_url> <br>
            Our github repo: https://github.com/ethanLongPham/OpenSource-Project.git
        </li>
        <li>Access the repository and run this .sql file: login_bellncozy_db.sql, <br>
            so that when using function on the website, information will be saved to database. <br>
            Make sure the port of Maria DB is 3307, because I already modify the port of php file to 3307. <br>
            Make sure you name your database the same as the .sql file
        </li>
        <li>
            Download and run Apache. Make sure the source code folder is in Apache document directory <br>
            If Apache is on, then you can try to access the web from whatever device using the same <br>
            wifi connection with the Raspberry Pi.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>To run the web app on Window</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>You can download XAMPP, as it easier to set up. It's already included Apache, <br>
            PHP, MySQL, etc.
        </li>
        <li>On XAMPP interface, start the Apache and MySQL services. Go to web browser and <br>
            search http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. You can take the SQL query from the .sql file <br>
            and create a database here.
        </li>
        <li>Then can just start to run the web
        </li>
        
    </ol>
